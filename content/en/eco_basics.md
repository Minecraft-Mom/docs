Minecraft.mom has a virtual currency making it easier to trade items and services with other players. This currency does not exist as items in-game, but rather as a balance on your account, much like a bank account. All players begin with a small amount of money to help get them started, but there are multiple ways to make more money.

## Economy Commands
You can use the following commands in chat:
- `/balance` - View your current account balance
- `/pay <player> <amount>` - Give the specified player the specified amount of money

## Making Money
The easiest way to make money is to sell items you do not need. You can use [Chest Shops](/shops) to sell items directly to other players. At the center of the spawn village, there is a hut where you can sell (almost) any item. Simply hold the item stack you want to sell, and you will be shown how much the server will pay for it. If you click, the item(s) will be sold.

## Tips
- You get a big bonus for every 24 hours of game time, allowing more active players to accrue more money.
- Wandering traders are now more common and will buy different items each time they spawn.
