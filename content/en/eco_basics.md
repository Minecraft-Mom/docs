Minecraft.mom has a virtual currency making it easier to trade items and services with other players. This currency does not exist as items in-game, but rather as a balance on your account, much like a bank account. All players begin with a small amount of money to help get them started, but there are multiple ways to make more money.

## Economy Commands
You can use the following commands in chat:
- `/balance` - View your current account balance
- `/pay <player> <amount>` - Give the specified player the specified amount of money

## Making Money
The easiest way to make money is to just play on the server! All players make 20₲ for every hour they spend active on the server. Every 24 hours spent active on the server comes with a bonus 2000₲.

You can buy item from and sell items to other players using [Chest Shops](/shops).

For extra income, players can sell items to Wandering Traders for cash certificates. These certificates can be used while held, adding the specified amount to the player's balance.

## Tips
- You get a big bonus for every 24 hours of game time, allowing more active players to accrue more money.
- Wandering traders are now more common and will buy different items each time they spawn.
