Minecraft.mom has a virtual currency making it easier to trade items and services with other players. This currency does not exist as items in-game, but rather as a balance on your account, much like a bank account. All players begin with a small amount of money to help get them started, but there are multiple ways to make more money.

## Economy Commands
You can use the following commands in chat:
- `/balance` - View your current account balance
- `/pay <player> <amount>` - Give the specified player the specified amount of money

## Making Money
The easiest way to make money is simply by playing the server. Although not much, players are awarded some money for every hour of playtime.

The quickest way to make money is to sell items you do not need. You can use [Chest Shops](/shops) to sell items directly to other players. If you go to spawn (using the /`/spawn` command) there is a large green statue where you can also sell many items directly to the server.  Simply hold the item stack you want to sell, and you will be shown how much the server will pay for it. If you click, the item(s) will be sold.
