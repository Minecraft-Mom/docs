Say the number of items you wish to buy or sell into chat. Assuming the chest has enough stock or room for your trade, you should see another message in chat.

## Creating a Chest Shop
Creating a shop chest is a simple process.

#### 1. Place a chest in the world
This chest will turn into a shop chest. There must be space in front of the chest for a sign to be automatically placed.

#### 2. Hold the item for the shop
Make sure you are holding the item in your hand you wish to sell.

#### 3. Sneak-Left-Click the chest
While holding the item, and while sneaking (holding `Left Shift`), you must punch the chest (`Left Click`).

A message will appear in chest, prompting you to enter the amount of money to sell one of the item for.

#### 4. Stock your chest shop
Open up the chest and fill it with the item you wish to sell. When players buy from the shop, it will remove those items from the chest.

#### 5. Tweak settings (optional)
If you `Right Click` on your own chest shop's sign, a menu will open in chat allowing you to change the shop's settings.

- `Shop mode` - Toggle your shop between buying and selling. This allows you to create a shop chest that buys items from players who use it.
- `Price` - Quickly change the price of your shop.
- `Remove Shop` - Click this to remove your shop. This destroys the sign.
